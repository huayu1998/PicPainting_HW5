# Painting APP
This homework exercises your abilities to fetch a picture from the camera, handle the multitouch event and use Canvas to create a customized image. The application to be developed is a picture-painting app: user takes a picture with a camera first, and draws lines and icons on the picture with multi-touch and gestures.
